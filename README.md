Graph Guru
----------

Graph Guru is a small app built as an R&D effort around understanding and evaluating Facebook Page Post Insights.

Graph Guru serves up certain insights in an easy to consume format for any manager or owner of a Facebook Business Page. 

This project submodules Facebook PHP SDK.
Fuel UX was used for the UI components, but not as a managed dependency.
